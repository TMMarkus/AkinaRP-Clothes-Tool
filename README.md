# AkinaRP-Clothes-Tool

This tool is an alternative version of Alt:V. In it, I have dedicated myself to adding new features and fixing errors since the original creator left it and preferred to rewrite a new one called DutyClothes.

I do this as an alternative for people who are looking for a decent and free tool to create clothing packs for their RP server.

### Additional Notes

Please note that the application is still in development, so there may be errors.
Also, my inexperience in developing this type of application may result in the application being a bit unstable XD
